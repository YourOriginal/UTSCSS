# NYC Bike Sharing

User metrics and data collection plays a key role in improving user satisfaction. In the case of bike sharing, understanding peak hours, gender usage, and other metrics can allow a company to prioritize a target audience and focus their resources during peak hours to ensure a steady flow of service. Using tableau, we will take a look at several of these metrics with regards to gender, peak hours, etc. to better understand our users and make future plans.

## Results

Several trends were noticed in the analysis. There were mostly male subscribers/users (65%) while both genders followed a consistent trend. Majority of trips peaked at the 5 minute mark and usage peaked during rush hours. This is expected as many users may be using the bike to get to work while on the weekends they may be using it for leisure. Times of peak are approximately 9am and 5/6pm on weekdays while weekends saw a more consistent usage throughout the day. Here we can see a rough visual summary of our results, view full results [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/janzen.liu/viz/module_16549219453320/Story1?publish=yes).

## Summary

Overall we notice a consistent trend of bike usage between users. We can use these trends to focus marketing, and resources to have a more efficient roll out of bike service. However, there are other metrics we should consider. We can use surveys to identify what usage they are using it for to better equip bikes and visualize the data much like a gender breakdown pie chart. Another important piece of information would be age breakdown. Understanding this can also help with marketing and resource allocations to areas more relevant to the dominant age group.

In conclusion, understanding this data can allow us to better plan for both future plans while also allowing us to improve the current dynamic between company and user.
