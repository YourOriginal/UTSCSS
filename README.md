# Hewlett-Packard (HP) SQL Analysis

Managing thousands of employees is a time consuming task if it has to be done by hand. The use of SQL databases and queries allows a user to perform a wide array of operations.

We will also determine which employees are eligible for the mentorship program and then export both datasets for further use by the company.
