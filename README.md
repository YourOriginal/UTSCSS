# Hewlett-Packard (HP) SQL Analysis

Managing thousands of employees is a time consuming task if it has to be done by hand. The use of SQL databases and queries allows a user to perform a wide array of operations to find what you need. In this analysis, we will use this powerful tool to determine retiring employees and their respective titles of the company given a set of paramaters. We will also determine which employees are eligible for the mentorship program and then export both datasets for further use by the company. 

## Analysis and Code

Prior to any SQL work, a database diagram was created to map out the various tables and other important information such as primary keys in an organized manner. 


With 6 tables and 6 csv files imported into our tables, we could then begin creating queries for the first task: determining retiring staff members and their respective titles.
