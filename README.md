  Stock analysis plays a pivotol role in many investors decision making. Trends and patterns can be visualized and thus informs the investor, allowing them to make informed decisions. While this analysis can be done in many ways such as excel for formulas and calculations, the manual and labour intensive process is also prone to mistakes.
