# My Kickstarter Analysis for U of T SCS Data Analytics

## Overview of Project

   Fundraising projects through kickstarter has become a popularized outlet for creators to attract the attention of fans while also generating funds to help assist in creating their goal. However, not all goals are reached. 
    
   In the case of Louise's play *Fever*, she was just shy of reaching her goal. Now, she's curious if there is a trend amongst kickstarter campaigns and their success rate in relation to the launch date and goal. In this project, we will analyze the data acquired from thousands of kickstarter campaigns and see if there are any trends in the data by using excel while primarily looking at the subcategory of theatre projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We first analyzed the data and compiled a pivot table containing the filters "Parent Category" and "Years" with our results in the columns and months of the year in rows as shown in the image below.

This pivot table provides a clean and organized set of data that summarizes our results for theatrical based Kickstarters based on the month of release which we then plotted onto a line graph


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
