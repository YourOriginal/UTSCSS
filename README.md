# UFO Sightings
 
The conspiracies of extraterrestial life has followed media for many years. Reported sightings across the world of various shapes, times and locations have garnered the attention of many people and have created widespread followings. While controversial, people are eager to share their findings with one another. It's important to keep track of data that is accessible to a wide range of people and now that people have access to the internet, what better place than the web? In this module, we will take data on UFO sightings and compile them into an interactable website to allow users to search said data.

## Results 

This site can be used by a variety of of people as they can search for UFO sightings to potentially find patterns and trends. A user can use a variety of search functions as highlighted below:

These are parameters commonly used amongst UFO sightings. After inputing various criteria, the user can view outputted results in the table beside.

The results will provide other details on specific sightings found based on the search criteria while users can then store for themselves.

## Summary

Due to the nature of the backend, we are relatively limited since the data is stored as a JS. For one, since the data is stored in a js, problems arise when sustainability, security, and flexibility is brought into the picture. Furthermore, the search function is limited to exact matches so results not showing up due to typos, and incomplete words are not "easy" for the consumers to use. Future patches/editions for sites like this should convert the data into a database like SQL which can allow users to input data.  Dana should also expand the search function to be more flexible. 

In summary, while this project is simple in theory, its potential can reach much higher ends with more investment in time and can grow to a more user centered site with stored data and trends.
